# API refresher project

[API Trivia Game](https://kcwit-trivia-quiz.herokuapp.com/api/)

Every Coding & Cocktails session is an opportunity to learn about a different piece of the full stack. This month's session covered APIs. In addition to creating a JSON-formatted API, we also created a Github repo and posted it on Heroku too. 

This little app takes two websites to use. The main link takes you to a functioning API. To add the trivia element, you get the second half of your URL by choosing your category, difficulty, and number of questions here: [Coding & Cocktails Trivia API](https://cocktail-trivia-api.herokuapp.com/)

To use the app: Go to the site linked at the top of the READme. In a separate windown, go to the Coding & Cocktails Trivia API. Once you generate a URL, grab everything after "api/" and add it to the first window, like this: 

* [API Trivia Game with 10 medium animal category questions](https://kcwit-trivia-quiz.herokuapp.com/api/category/animals/difficulty/medium)

A little unconventional, but a great start on an app I'll save if I ever want to create a more fully functioning self-contained app.
